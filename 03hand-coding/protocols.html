    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Hydrate Well:</strong>
      Drink water consistently throughout the day. Add a pinch of sea salt to one or two glasses to support minerals and energy.

      <strong>Prioritize Rest:</strong>
      Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night and keep a consistent sleep schedule.
    </li>

      <strong>Reduce Daily Stress:</strong>
      Practice simple stress-reducing habits like deep breathing, walking, journaling, or time outside.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Start Gentle Movement:</strong>
      Include 10–20 minutes of easy movement daily—walking, stretching, or light yoga.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Observe and Track Symptoms:</strong>
      Note changes in digestion, energy, mood, and sleep to recognize patterns over time.

  <h2>Key Terms to Know</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Inflammation</dt>
    <dd>
      The body’s natural response to injury or stress. When it becomes chronic, it can contribute 
      to fatigue, pain, digestive issues, and increased autoimmune activity.
    </dd>

    <dt>Gut Lining</dt>
    <dd>
      A protective barrier in the digestive tract that regulates what substances pass into the 
      bloodstream. When weakened, it can trigger immune reactions and food sensitivities.
    </dd>

    <dt>Detox Pathways</dt>
    <dd>
      Systems in the body—mainly the liver, kidneys, skin, and lymphatic system—that filter and 
      remove waste. Supporting these pathways helps maintain overall health and reduce toxin load.
